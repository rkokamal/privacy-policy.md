# MultiFind Pro Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: December 17, 2025**

MultiFind Pro is a browser extension that enhances in-page text search with multi-word highlighting, color coding, search history, excludes, and export features.

### Data Collection and Usage
- We **do not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data, search terms, or browsing activity to any servers.
- The extension temporarily reads page content **only** to highlight search matches on the current webpage.
- Search history and excluded selectors are stored **locally** on your device using browser storage (localStorage and chrome.storage).
- No data ever leaves your browser.

### Permissions Explained
- The extension uses standard Chrome permissions (`activeTab`, `scripting`, `storage`) to inject the search toolbar and save your preferences.
- All processing happens locally — no remote servers or analytics.

### Third Parties
- We do **not** share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties.
- No tracking, analytics, or ads are included.

### Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy occasionally. Changes will be reflected here.
